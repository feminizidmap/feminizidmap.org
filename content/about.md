We document all [femi(ni)cides](#we-call-it-feminicide-or-femicide) and killings of women* and girls* in Germany. Femi(ni)cide is intended to apply to certain killings of women* and girls* by men, those which occur in a context of a hierarchical power relationships where the subjects, women\*/girls\*, are placed on one side of that power structure, that of the subordinated; it is not meant to simply differentiate killings by the sex of the victims, distinguishing between homicides for males and femi(ni)cides for females. You can find more information on these concepts [below](#definitions).

We acknowledge that we were inspired and helped by the work of [Feminicidio.net](https://feminicidio.net).

### We call it feminicide or femicide

The choice of terms has generated a heated debate amongst theorists and activists in the Americas, and there is no consensus on the matter. We are a diverse team, and each of us has our own naming preferences as well as definitions. Therefore, we use femi(ni)cide as an abbreviation of femicide and feminicide, to build conversations and enable collaborations.

- > Feminicide: The murders of women and girls founded in a gender power structure [it is] gender-based violence that is both public and private, implicating both the state (directly or indirectly) and individual perpetrators (private or state actors); it thus encompasses systematic, widespread, and everyday interpersonal violence [it is] systematic violence rooted in social, political, economic, and cultural inequalities. In this sense, [its analysis is not only focused] on gender but also in the intersection of gender dynamics with the cruelties of racism and economic injustices in local as well as global contexts (Fregoso and Bejarano, 2010).
