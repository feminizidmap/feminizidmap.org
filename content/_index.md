## The Feminicide Map is a research project on the murder of women* by men in Germany.
Feminicides are a sad part of everyday life in Germany. But the current data situation is poor. We therefore provide comprehensive information on murders of women by men in Germany.

## On every third day in Germany, a man kills his (ex)-partner. The number of unreported cases of feminicides is even higher, as official statistics have only a limited definition of the term.

## XXX cases in 2019

## Femicides are murders

In the case of feminicides in families or relationships, the media still speak in many cases of "relationship act", " crime of passion" or "tragedy". This plays down the deeds, as it is not visible that it is violence against women. Terms such as "drama" and "tragedy" create associations of a fateful event that conceal the fact that men kill women in these acts because they believe they have a right to see women subordinate.
	
We therefore document not only the context of the crime and the relationship to the perpetrator, but also the language the media use in their reporting.
