title: A research project on feminicides in Germany
slug: project
description: We document all murders of women* by men in Germany. And, we aim to develop an online database on femi(ni)cide, the killing of women* because they are women* by men, in Germany.
---


The aim of the online database is to collect and systematize qualitative and quantitative data about the contexts of these killings from various sources such as media outlets, police reports and court decisions, complying with scientific standards. The online database will provide geographical reference to the crimes, access to the sources/archives, and produce automatize statistics and graphics for further analysis. We got inspiration and help from the work done by Feminicidio.net.
We use femi(ni)cide as an abbreviation of femicide and feminicide, and thus we aim to build conversations and enabling collaborations. We are a diverse team, and each of us have their naming preferences, as well as definitions. We are able to start working with a basic understanding of femi(ni)cide, but that does not mean that we all have share the same definitions, we think this will be updating while we develop this project. 

## Why we are doing this project

In the first instance, this project was conceived due to the limitations that current criminal statistics provide on regard femi(ni)cide cases. However, the fact that certain types of killings disproportionately affect women* (e.g. being killed by a partner, ex-partner or a family member) asks for disaggregate data that allows for deeper analysis of contexts and patterns. 

The above interest was reinforced by the willing to challenge the UNODC statement by Germany, 2014, on the investigation and prosecution of gender-related killings of women and girls: “Femicide (understood as the killing of women simply because of their gender and to which there is little or no state reaction) is not a phenomenon which can be found in Germany.” 
From a governmental level, what we found is a negation of this phenomenon, and, consequently, there is little data about these crimes, and there is not available accurate information about the numbers and their characteristics.

Ultimately, we want to do this project because we want to have a real picture of this phenomenon in Germany. And, thus, provide useful information for societal actors such as civil society, scholars, and policymakers to better plan strategies to fight this phenomenon.


## How do we differentiate from other projects

Before we started this project, we made a mapping on databases on femi(ni)cide in Germany. We only found one project doing a very limited documentation. 

First, we want to work with a concept that makes justice to the complexity of the phenomenon of femi(ni)cide. This means, that we work with a broad and ongoing definition of femi(ni)cide: therefore we do not document only intimate femi(ni)cide but other cases such as racist femi(ni)cide, femi(ni)cide per prostitution, non-intimate femi(ni)cide, family femi(ni)cide, and transphobic femi(ni)cide.

Secondly, we also acknowledge and take seriously the work done on femi(ni)cide by scholars, policymakers, politicians and activists from the global South. This does not mean to copy/paste what has already been done for other contexts, but to translate it into the German context. This can be seen e.g.: in the broad use of femi(ni)cide we use, the already discussed femi(ni)cide types (without forgetting that some are still under development), the use of data sources such as media, and the interactive georeferencing maps. 

Third, we distance ourselves from attempts to instrumentalize violence against women* for racist politics and moral panicking. 

Fourth, we want to encourage civil society participation in the documentation process. Finally, we are also aware of the emergence of new similar projects, therefore we want to join forces and network with other projects and thus strengthen the fight against these crimes.
