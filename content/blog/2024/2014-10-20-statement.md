# Critical comments to the draft bill by CDU/CSU: “Criminal Code and other laws - Improving victim protection, especially for women and vulnerable persons”

[Femi(ni)cides](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/728061) – our combination of the terms “feminicide” and “femicide,” both of which are used to refer to the killing of women by men because they are women – and attempted femi(ni)cides happen almost every day in Germany. According to official BKA statistics, more women have been killed than men in the past three years ([2021](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/2022/BundesdatenDelikte/03_MordTotschlagToetungAufVerlangenBRD.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2), [2022](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/2023/BundesdatenDelikte/03_MordTotschlagToetungAufVerlangenBRD.html), [2023](https://www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/PKS2023/AusgewaehlteInformationenBund/AusgewaehlteInformationenBund_node.html)). From a global
perspective, Germany is currently most likely one of the few countries in the world with more female than male victims in completed homicides. Unlike male victims, a significant proportion of female victims are killed by intimate partners, family members, or acquaintances.
In this scenario, the CDU/CSU fraction in the German parliament submitted a draft bill to amend the criminal code, “Criminal Code and other laws – Improving victim protection, especially for women and vulnerable persons” ([Doc. 20/12085, 02.07.2024](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/120/2012085.pdf)). The parliamentary discussion took place on July 4, and the bill is currently being discussed in the judiciary
committee (see the status of the bill [here](https://dip.bundestag.de/vorgang/gesetz-zur-%C3%A4nderung-des-strafgesetzbuches-und-weiterer-gesetze-verbesserung/313674)).

As researchers with extensive experience in studying femi(ni)cide and participating in activism around the issue in Germany, we welcome the discussion around the subject that the draft bill has generated, and we feel compelled to share our critical insights on it. We believe it is essential to consider existing knowledge and expertise on the matter, take into account Germany’s ratification of the [Istanbul Convention](https://dip.bundestag.de/vorgang/gesetz-zur-%C3%A4nderung-des-strafgesetzbuches-und-weiterer-gesetze-verbesserung/313674), and reflect on previous discussions about the subject (such as [Doc. 19/23999](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/19/239/1923999.pdf) and [Plenary session 19/192](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btp/19/19192.pdf)). Our opinion encompasses six general aspects: the systematic nature of femi(ni)cide, the need to acknowledge the existence of various types of femi(ni)cide, the urgent need for a comprehensive law (beyond mere criminalization), the relevance of involving diverse societal actors in decision-making debate, the importance of avoiding politicisation of the problem and its strategies, and the need for comprehensive data on femi(ni)cides.

1. **Acknowledging femi(ni)cide as a structural problem.** Femi(ni)cide is not merely a
“private” or “individual” issue; rather, it is a [structural social problem](https://www.utupub.fi/handle/10024/174532) rooted in social constructions and power dynamics related to sex/gender. A structural approach to addressing femi(ni)cide involves tackling its root causes at all levels, including government institutions, society, and individual behaviours, rather than relying solely on superficial reforms. The Istanbul Convention requires plans addressing all of the following aspects: necessary modifications to law codes and comprehensive policies;
development of data collection and comprehensive policies; the establishment of
strategies of prevention through education, awareness, and training programs;
development of protection and support tools; and international cooperation and
monitoring mechanisms. Nevertheless, femi(ni)cide is still not officially recognized as
a structural problem by German legislation. Consequently, we criticize the bill’s
emphasis on individuals’ body size and physical strength rather than on sex/gender
power dynamics (which affect both women and men); limiting the focus to those
physical aspects could have serious implications for court cases, introducing inaccurate
assumptions or failing to address the motives and issues that are truly at stake. While
individual responsibility deserves condemnation, it is equally true that societal and
governmental responsibilities play a crucial role and should also be tackled. Thus, we
recommend that any bill or strategy address all these layers of responsibility.

2. **Addressing femi(ni)cide in its complexity.** Femi(ni)cide is a complex phenomenon
that manifests in various ways. Data from the BKA indicates that in the past year, 339
women were killed in Germany, with 202 of these cases reported in detail by national
newspapers. Preliminary analysis from [Feminizidmap](https://feminizidmap.org/about/) shows that out of these 202
killings, 45% of the women were most likely killed by their partner or ex-partner, and
about 35% were most likely killed by other male relatives or acquaintances (including
admirers, fathers, sons, brothers, colleagues, and pimps). The bill at hand mentions
killings of women by their (ex-)partners, especially in relation to separation, but it
neglects the fact that femi(ni)cide extends beyond intimate partner violence. Social
scientists have been developing categories – such as intimate, family-related, non-
intimate, child-related, serial, and racist femi(ni)cide – to better comprehend the
dynamics of each [type](https://feminicidio.net/types-of-feminicide-or-variants-of-extreme-patriarcal-violence/). The analysis of these categories is intended to inform policies.
Without comprehensive data on all types of femi(ni)cide, there is a risk of developing
strategies that target only a fraction of the overall problem. While we appreciate
proposals addressing intimate femi(ni)cide, which constitutes a significant percentage
of the total femi(ni)cides in Germany, we question reducing the problem solely to this
type of femi(ni)cide.

3. **Aiming for a comprehensive law.** Researchers on femi(ni)cide have [differentiated two
types of laws](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/728061): unidirectional laws, meaning those that focus only on the criminal aspect
and include the category only in the penal code; and mainstreaming laws, which
consider elements of prevention, assistance, and reparation beyond the criminal sphere.
A mainstreaming approach stresses that criminalising femi(ni)cide per se is not the
solution to these crimes, but rather one part of a comprehensive strategy that covers
many socio-cultural aspects. A mainstreaming approach also considers implementation
and processes to raise awareness among the judiciary, since it is not enough to have a
good law if it is not correctly applied. Criminalisation of femi(ni)cide alone, as has been
proven in other contexts, will not solve the problem.

4. **Incorporating insights from various experts into the discussion.** Femi(ni)cide spans
multiple societal spheres, thus necessitating comprehensive debates and strategic action
plans that involve various societal actors. While the perspectives of criminal lawyers
are relevant, input from other legal domains is equally important. Additionally, insights
from various societal actors, such as sociologists, economists, social workers, and civil
society, are equally significant. Therefore, we believe that a draft bill should emerge
from such comprehensive dialogue.

5. **Avoiding the politicisation of femi(ni)cide.** Femi(ni)cide in particular, and violence
against women in general, are problems that should concern all parliamentarians,
regardless of their party affiliation. However, the current debates around femi(ni)cide
in Germany carry a significant risk of becoming a politicised matter, as the discussion
in the German Bundestag on the proposal 19/23999 shows (see the analysis of this [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-14706-7_6)). An example of good practice in this regard is provided by the case of Mexico,
where all political blocs were able to establish dialogue and work together towards the
drafting of a law that addressed femi(ni)cide. Thus, a key question in the current debate
is whether German politicians will be able to overcome their differences and collaborate
effectively to address the problem based on scientific findings.

6. **Documenting comprehensive data on femi(ni)cide.** As members of the independent
research project Feminizidmap, which documents all killings of women reported by the
media since 2019 in Germany in detail, we recognize the urgent need for [comprehensive
data](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-14706-7_6) and research on femi(ni)cide in Germany. Such research can be the basis for data-
driven legislation and other accompanying strategies.

Finally, we make a call to avoid discussing femi(ni)cide from racist and xenophobic
perspectives that incorrectly place sole blame on non-Western cultures for these crimes. We
hope that the discussion of the current draft bill will stimulate a more comprehensive dialogue
on femi(ni)cides in Germany, considering the points we have outlined here.
